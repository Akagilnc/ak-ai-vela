# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Database backup now uses SQLite VACUUM INTO for consistent snapshots (safe during writes)
- All database paths (prisma client, seed script, backup utility) now read DATABASE_URL with fallback
- Removed hard grade/birthYear constraints from questionnaire schema (no longer enforces range)
- Seed script split into safe upsert mode (db:seed) and destructive reset mode (db:reset --reset)

### Fixed
- .env.example pointed to wrong database path (./dev.db → ./prisma/dev.db)
- Backup tests now properly isolate DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Backup tests verify data integrity using real SQLite databases instead of fake files

### Added
- 3 new Zod schema edge-case tests (activities, animalExperience, budgetRange) — 14 tests total
- TODOS.md for tracking deferred work items (next/link, Prisma Json type, schema range fields)
